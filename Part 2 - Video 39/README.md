# Stepper Motor
The code, library and other stuff you need for YouTube video #39 (www.youtube.com/c/ralphbacon)  
(Direct link to video: https://youtu.be/3VTcL2hMDdA)

The code appears here for visitors to my YouTube video who cannot download from dropbox.

Ubiquitous unipolar Stepper Motor 28BYJ-48 is easy to use for robots, cars and here a temperature gauge, along with the DS18B20 one-wire temperature sensor. 

We're using a great stepper library allowing smooth transitions from standstill and allowing the motor to be switched off too, saving power (great for battery use) as well as preventing the motor overheating.

In *the previous* video #38 (part 1) we look at some very simple code just to test out the stepper motor and what we need to do to ensure that we always start from a known position (easy for servos, hard for stepper motors).

In *this* video #39 (part 2) we take the project to its conclusion with some easy coding and a nice, simple construction so don't miss it!

All the files you need (the code (sketch) and libraries) that we will be using as well as other useful information are right here in this repository:

1. Final sketch (code)  

2. A picture of the (almost) final unit hanging in my extremely warm workshop:  

3. The AccelStepper library (zip file)  

4. The DallasTemperature library (zip file)
