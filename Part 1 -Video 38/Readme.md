# Stepper Motor (part 1)

Use in conjunction with my video #38 at https:/www.youtube.com/RalphBacon  
(Direct link to video: https://youtu.be/0TNBxt5hF-g)

Ubiquitous unipolar Stepper Motor 28BYJ-48 is easy to use for robots, cars and here a temperature gauge, along with the DS18B20 temperature sensor. 

We're using a great stepper library allowing smooth transitions from standstill and allowing the motor to be switched off too, saving power (great for battery use) as well as preventing the motor overheating.

In *this* video #38 (part 1) we look at some very simple code just to test out the stepper motor and what we need to do to ensure that we always start from a known position (easy for servos, hard for stepper motors).

In the *next* video #39 (part 2) we take the project to its conclusion with some easy coding and a nice, simple construction so don't miss it!

Here are the links to the code (sketch) and libraries that we will be using as well as other useful information:

1. AccelStepper library: http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/index.html 
Note this is not the usual GitHub repository (although many variants/forks do exists there). Read this page and download the zip file. Also contains links to all the class methods and several examples. Very mature and robust library. A copy of this library is also available in my GitHub repository (see step 2).

2. Very simple demo code right here in this repository!
