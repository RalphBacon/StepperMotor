# Stepper Motor (parts 1 & 2)

The code, library and other stuff you need for YouTube videos #38 and #39 (https://www.youtube.com/ralphbacon)

Open the folder to get the sketch for the video you want to follow.

In **video #38 (part 1)** we look at some very simple code just to test out the stepper motor and what we need to do to ensure that we always start from a known position (easy for servos, hard for stepper motors).

In **video #39 (part 2)** we take the project to its conclusion with some easy coding and a nice, simple construction so don't miss it!

The libraries are common to both video and are right here in this repository (I recommend you use these rather than any later versions to avoid problems with backward compatibility)

I've also included a picture of the (nearly) final project which is still hanginf in my workshop.
